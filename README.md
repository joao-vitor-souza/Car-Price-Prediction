### Regression Model to Forecast a Used Car Price


> This application aims to provide a regression model capable of estimating a car's price. Suppose a used car store is interested in buying a vehicle and needs to know its real market value. Instead of using intuition and a limited knowledge of all variables that influence the price, it can use this model to predict the value at which the car is commonly sold, and then, guided by this value, it can offer a lower bid, aiming greater profits on resale.
